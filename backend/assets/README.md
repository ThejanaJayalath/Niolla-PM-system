# Proposal PDF assets

## Company logo (cover page)

To show your company logo on the proposal PDF cover page:

1. **File name:** `proposal-logo.png` (or `proposal-logo.jpg`)
2. **Location:** Place the file in this folder:  
   `backend/assets/proposal-logo.png`

Supported formats: PNG or JPG.  
Recommended size: about 200–400 px wide so it scales clearly on the cover.

If the file is missing, the cover page will show "NIOLLA" text instead of the logo.
